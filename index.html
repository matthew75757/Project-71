    <h4>New School Canteen</h4>
    <img src="canteen.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
      The School food and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient
      than they have been in the past. Online menus with photos of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions
      of the ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff
      member who acceses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps
      track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a 
      box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less 
      complicated for staffs and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

    <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
    <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
      Implemented Online Attendance Management System: This informs parents about their child's/children's activities 
      in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via
      text messages. This helps schools keep a record of the student's absent absenteeism. Students can mark the 
      attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can be later checked by the admin. 
      The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and
      not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their cirriculum's subjects. As soon as you 
      enter a student's Enrollment Number or Name, details like avaliability in classes, number of lectures attended 
      will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. 
      Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans 
      are caught in a shorter span — just after the admin enters login details into this tracker. All this 
      will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their teachers
      are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at 
      reduced costs.
